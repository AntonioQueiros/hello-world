The Cisco IMC Visore Utility

Visore is a utility built into Cisco IMC that allows a user to easily browse Managed Objects (MOs) using an HTML browser. The Visore utility uses the Cisco IMC XML API query methods to browse the MOs active in Cisco 
IMC. The Visore utility cannot be used to perform configuration operations.

Accessing Visore:
To access Visore, open a browser and enter one of the following URLs:
	• http://<Cisco IMC IP Address>/visore.html 
	• https://<Cisco IMC IP Address>/visore.html 

When prompted, log in using the same credentials you would use to log in to the Cisco IMC CLI or GUI user interfaces.

Using Visore to Query a Class:
To query for a particular class, enter the class name in the Class or DN field and click Run Query. Visore sends a configResolveClass method to Cisco IMC and the requested MO is displayed in a tabular format..

Use the < and > buttons to retrieve the Parent and Child class of the displayed MO. For example, clicking > sends a configResolveChildren method to Cisco IMC to query for the child of the MO. Clicking < sends a configResolveParent method to Cisco IMC to query for the parent of the MO.


Using Visore to Query a Distinguished Name(DN):
To query for a particular DN, enter the DN in the Class or DN field and click Run Query. Visore sends a configResolveDn method to Cisco IMC.
